# LunaGameBackend

My LunaGameBackend is a RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**. It allows users to **sign up, log in, and manage roles** for the Knocksman and Player entities in the Luna game. The API includes **full CRUD functionality** for both roles and is documented with **Swagger** for easy testing and integration.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login** with role selection (`knocksman` or `player`)
- **CRUD operations**:
  - Create users
  - Read user information
  - Update user information
  - Delete users
- **Secure password storage** with `bcryptjs`
- **Swagger UI** for API documentation and testing
- **CORS enabled** for frontend integration
- **PostgreSQL database** connection with SSL support
